# Data Visualization demo
Metascience Design Lab - Project Team 2

Usera are able to draw and view different graphs such as histogram and scatter plot, which are generated automatically by the script from a csv file. We hope such data visualization can help general public understand research papers and interact with data easily.

This is for demo use only.
