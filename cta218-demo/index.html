						<h2>What is Cyberpunk?</h2>
					</header>
					<section>
						<header>
							<h3>Definition</h3>
						</header>
						<p>The first appearance of the word "cyberpunk" was in a short story by Bruce Bethke published in November 1983. The word was coined in early spring of 1980, which referred to bizarre and high-tech science fictions in the eighties (The Cyberpunk Project).</p>
						<p>This word is a combination of "cyber" and "punk". "Cyber" comes from cybernetics, a science studying control and communication in animals and the machine. The term originates in the Greek language word "kubernetes" which in English is translated to "pilot". Cybernetics involves machines that imitate human behavior. The other part of the name "punk" is an anarchistic youth movement which buzzed the world in seventies and eighties. Punk refers to the loud hard-core rock music. "Punk" originally means "junk". A "punk" is a antisocial rebel and troublemaker. In the word "cyberpunk", punk focuses more on the anarchistic and anti-authoritarian attitude (The Cyberpunk Project).</p>
						
						<blockquote>"The future is already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; –- William Gibson </blockquote>

						<p>Cyberpunk focuses on highly advanced technology in an urban dystopian future. It features on a combination of low life and high tech which includes highly advanced technological and scientific achievements such as artificial intelligence and VR. This ideology remains the same across 50 years. Technologies have failed to clear social divisions and leave the poor people poorer and rich people more wealthy (Ian, et al. 2015). Because of this huge gap, there are powerful mega-corporations and private security forces, as well as dark transactions in the underworld of illegal trade, gangs and drugs. Cyberpunk is now a culture symbol for a world not in peace but rather in chaos and disorder.</p>

							<h2>My Interest</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I am a computer science major and many professors recommended The Terminator and The Matrix. Surprisingly, I haven’t watched those two but many other sci-fi movies such as Ready Player One and Alita Battle Angel, and the recently released Netflix series Love, Death and Robots. I think this topic is closely related to my major and I have always wanted to explore the new world through technology. I do not like science fictions because usually it is hard to imagine the future and I cannot be convinced of what would happen by simple descriptions in words. Science fiction movies provide a better lens through which I can see and experience the possible future.</p>

							<h2>Analysis and Evaluation</h2>
						</header>
							<p>I did some research on one of the very earlist and one of the latest. Through the detailed explanation and comparison, I hope to share how cyberpunk movies impact us as a genre. If you have not seen any of these two movies, you are welcome to watch the trailers below.</p>

							<h3>The Matrix (1999)</h3>

							<p>Time flies back to 1999. A man names Thomas Anderson (also known as Neo) lives an ordinary life. He is a software developer at day and a computer hacker at night. He usually works at his desk and waiting for a signal from his monitor. He does not know what signal he is waiting for until one night, a mysterious woman called Trinity lures him out and introduces him to that faceless character Morpheus he has been waiting for. Morpheus reveals the truth about his world to Thomas and asks for his help (Pereyra).</p>
							<p>One can tell this film really shows a "standard" approach to shot cyberpunk science-fiction movies. Through the narrative, you can see many common elements of stories. Cyberpunk movies show audience a wild imagination with surprising characters empowered by advanced technology and inconceivable plots that blow our mind.We see the programmer and hacker as the main character. The setting is simple but it induces a complicated story behind the signal. By creating such a mysterious and even a little scary atmosphere, audiences are brought in the movie and allowed to deduct the plot by themselves. This coincides with the saying in a TED talk in Lesson 7, "drama is anticipation mingled with uncertainty".</p>
							<p>This film uses new technology such as virtual reality, which is merely a concept back in 1999. There are things that we cannot even achieve today including flying cars and assassinating robots. The Matrix sets a newsstand for how the futuristic movies can go. It does not load the character with technological ideas but instead provides a dependent lifeline to it. The relationship of human and machine is symbiotic, which is a far sight (Kay 2019). Human and robots depend on each other and need each’s support in order to survive. Humans no longer have full control over their life but now manipulated by virtual reality and machines. This groundbreaking concept is practiced in this masterpiece, opening a brand-new way of depicting the future. One recent blockbuster that focuses on virtual reality is Ready Player One directed by Steven Spielberg.</p>

							<p>Directed by famous filmmaker Robert Rodriguez and supervised by James Cameron, this science fiction movie brings us to a future world where Alita (Rosa Salazar) awakens with memory erased. She has no idea who she is and does not recognize the village. A doctor Ido (Christoph Waltz) finds she amazing and realizes there is something special about her heart under this abandoned cyborg. As Alita is saved by the doctor and learns to navigate her new life in the Iron City, Ido has to hide her from her memories. However a new friend Hugo (Keean Johnson) appears and tries to help Alita bring back her memory. At the same time, corrupt forces in the city go after Alita because they recognize her unique heart and fighting abilities in accident. Alita needs to use her power to save her friends, family and the world, which is in chaos (Wheeler & Veritas 2019).</p>
							<p>James Cameron has been worked on some of the best cyberpunk movies such as Terminator 2 and Aliens that defined the most powerful female archetypes in the cyberpunk field. The Alita animation is based on a real person and in order to differentiate the animated character and the real person, filmmakers deliberately modified the ratio of eyes to the face and enlarged the eyes. This step involves more technical difficulties and takes more money to achieve than fully imitating a person. I was very excited when I watched it on the first day. I love this feature and how James and his team pursue the technical epic at such a detailed level. However, not everyone is happy with this new approach. </p>
							<blockquote>"When I heard that they were making a live-action adaptation, I had a mixed reaction." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; –- Wheeler</blockquote>
							<p>Alita’s CG rendered eyes are a little weird which probably draw some portion of audience away before the film starts showing (Wheeler & Veritas 2019). It is sad but normal to see how part of audience are afraid of new techniques used in films and therefore prefer not to watch the movie. Luckily, of the history of technical innovations, this small portion of people never stop filmmakers to make new breakthroughs and set a good example for later movies.</p>
							<p>There is a more detailed review from professional critic Wheeler on Neon Dystopia's website (my last reference). Feel free to explore more if you are also passionate about Alita!</p>

							<p>Since this type of movies focus on the unknown future, it tells the stories through myth from a narrative perspective. We are familiar with ancient myth that help us explain certain phenomenon that we cannot make sense otherwise. Myth is not limited to prehistory and still plays an important role in pop culture today. There is a collective need for myth because we give higher meaning to our existence. We would like to believe we can predict what will happen tomorrow or in 10 years. We feel close to this kind of creatures. That’s why we often see robots and machines are empowered to think and behave like us. They can talk and have a certain level of intelligence. However, we are afraid of the negative impacts of cyberpunks as we see in movies some robots break the rules we set for them. For example, in Love, Death and Robots, robots take over the world and humans have to fight with robots to earn themselves a place in society.</p>

					<h3>Get ready for its huge impact</h3>
					<p>After analyzing two movies in detail, let us take a look at the huge impact of cyberpunk. There are three main impacts that I would like to discuss with you today, including impact on the film industry, impact on our daily life, and impact on other forms of pop culture.</p>

						<h2>Impact on Film Industry</h2>
					</header>

						<p>As discussed above, both movies have technical breakthroughs and many later movies follow the styles, themes, shotting approaches of early movies. The Matrix and Alita are not the only ones. There are much more such as recent series Love, Death and Robots. We see filmmakers such as James Cameron has tried different approaches since a very early stage and always wanted to push the technology forward. He and many other great directors together lay a good foundation and set an example for cyberpunk science fiction movies.</p>

						<p>From a visual perspective, technical advances provide us fully immersive, totally convincing virtual reality as if we were on the shuttle bus to the near future. Compared to words and paragraphs on paper, moving visual images fill the imagination gap between the author and the audience and offers the world a magnificently constructed future. Finally audience leave the cinema with a sense of fulfillment, excitement, and visual pleasure.</p>

						<h2>Impact on Lifestyle</h2>
					</header>

					<p>It is surprising to notice even our daily routine are adapted because of cyberpunk themes. Cyberpunk cultures are to some degree influenced by Asians. It is a global topic, a meshing of individual cultures to form a large melting pot. Noodles is one of global representations. You can see almost in every cyberpunk films, there are noodles. The noodle and cyberpunk story originates in the eighties with a focus on Japanese takeover of the United States. During this time, a huge number of transactions and trading took place. Japanese businesses were buying out and taking over U.S. companies. Wall Street was scared that Japanese may take over the entire country, so cyberpunk culture integrated noodles and other Asian themes to show that the society may turn in a cyberpunk utopian (Cordell 2018).</p>
					<p>Another thing to notice is the price. A noodle bowl costs less money and is the primary source of happiness in the harsh life of lower-class cyberpunk life (Cordell 2018). Therefore, cyberpunk culture includes noodles and represents the life of people at that time owing to the cultural and economic class structure in cyberpunk society.</p>

						<h2>Impact on Gaming</h2>
					</header>

					<p>
						In last year’s E3 gaming conference, Cyberpunk 2077 was widely discussed. It is a neon cyberpunk game that has The Witcher 3 developer CD Projekt Red moving from a high fantasy world to a science fiction world metropolis. This is a game based on the RPG of the same name yet plays like The Matrix game that we see in the film 20 years ago (Hood, Leger, & Boyle 2019). It is exciting to see how other industries are influenced by cyberpunk culture and how people expect and enjoy interactions with robots in game.
